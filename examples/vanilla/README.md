# VanillaJS + Automerge + Prosemirror

This is an example of using `automerge-prosemirror` in a vanilla JavaScript project. "vanilla" here means that there are no additional UI frameworks, we are still using Vite for bundling because we need to bundle the `@automerge/automerge-wasm` package.

## How to run

```
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
